# Tumor-Diagnosis-Project

In this project, I employed the statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, to discover and explore the relationships in the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** data set. 

After an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, I built a boosted decision tree classifier with *XGBoost* to classify tumors as either **malignant** or **benign**.
